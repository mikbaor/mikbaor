# 👋 Hello! My name is Mikhail Baez.

## 🙋🏻‍♂️**Who am I?**
I am a ***Fullstack*** programmer who finds himself always learning new technologies for creating applications.

Since I was little I always had an interest in programming. My first programming language that I saw was Php. But what made me take it more seriously was when I was introduced to Mq4.

## 👨🏻‍💻 **What I do?**

I am currently dedicated to carrying out projects that allow me to advance my training as a programmer. **I believe that people's daily lives can always be improved or facilitated with code**.

## ⭐ **What goals do I have?**
I would like to create projects that change the current paradigms for solving problems that were thought to have been solved.

I find it quite motivating to see the demand for programmers that are sought today, in my opinion we are creating a new world that is also full of opportunities.

## **What technologies do I use?**
When I started I learned very vague notions of php, the rest I learned on YouTube, onDemand learning platforms such as udemy but what really gave me the impulse and understanding was taking the Bootcamp at Henry, since it has allowed me to gain fundamental experience to take off . That has motivated me to continue learning and now I am moving towards a professional certificate at IBM. The technologies I manage are:

Javascript | React | RectNative | Tailwind | Node.js | Express | JavaScript | PostgreSql | Sequelize | Php | Python | Css | Html | Typescript
